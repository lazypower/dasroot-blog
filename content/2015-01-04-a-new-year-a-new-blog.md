Summary: 2014 held a lot of interesting things for me, both personally and professionally. I had a long and serious internal monologue with myself deciding if I really wanted to write this post. I think that overall it's important to recap what you've experienced over the past year so you have a clear cut vision of where you've come from; and thus - where you might be going.

## The Retrospective

### Almost a year at Canonical

January 20'th 2015 will mark 1 full year at Canonical as a full-time employee. I have to say that I've come a long way from the strong headed solo developer that was hired on the Juju Solutions Team. I had a great grasp of what I thought the project needed back then - or so I thought. Everything under the sun needed a charm; and as a rubyist that meant I had all the candy in the universe to keep me busy... right? I was sorely mistaken in the fact that just because a charm exists, doesn't neccessarily mean it's awesome - nor does that mean that a single person should be writing hundred's of charms for public consumption.

The Great Charm Audit of 2014 performed primarily by [Matt Bruzek](http://bruzer.net) taught me quite a few lessons in charming, and what key aspects will help us to succeed in achieving our mission critical goal.

- Charms Need Automated Tests
- Charms Need *full* documentation to be useful to anyone
- Charms are honest and legitimate software projects - not toys.
- Quality Software takes time
- None of this is hard persay, just time consuming.

In addition to the tennants of Charms and leveraging Juju - I've learned quite a bit about being an upstanding member of the [community](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LazyPower) and what it means to foster a community. The Juju community at large is still relatively small in terms of population - so it's even more important to ensure we are treating them like the first class citizens they are.

The Juju Charmer Team has grown from a small 3 man operation at the beginning of 2014 to 7 members swooping in and out of the Review Queue like super hero's right out of a comic book. It's very important to remember to be appreciative of these folks. We have gained our first [community charmer](https://www.google.com/+Jos%C3%A9AntonioRey) among our ranks - who is donating his time ensuring that incoming charms are receiving a prompt and curteous first round review. It's been an absolute joy to [foster his growth and development](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iaMe8TyUVXfXjePbyhnNkGkewAj7P3MorEyNgjc3ODM/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000) from a community member being [promoted right into ~charmer status](https://www.mail-archive.com/juju@lists.ubuntu.com/msg01234.html). 

### Code Reviews

I remember back in early 2012 [I was very concerned with Documentation](/more-documentation-really.html), as I felt like my code wasn't self documenting enough. Since that time I've undergone a few more years of professional development - written several thousand more lines of code, and have come to the conclusion that the thousands of lines of code that I have written scare me. Every line of code that I've written up to the early portion of 2014 was only used internally at a marketing agency, or on client websites that were tested by the hands of 2 over-worked individuals before it landed in production.

Flash forward to 2015 and before anything gates from a namespace branch into any form of recommended or production listing - it's got a solid two or three people's hands on it, commenting about: readability, comments, docstrings, why did you loop twice when you could have mapped with a dictionary? to name a few things. Its been an amazing period of growth for my craft - as I continue to consider new and developing technologies to leverage in my professional life. I am thankful for every last person that has put up with the late nights, crazy code quality, and rushed reviews so we can make a deadline for our clients. You ladies and gentleman deserve a medal and time off for dedicated efforts to making software a better place for everyone to dwell.

### An aside on hobbies and music

As my posts have also alluded to, my hobbies have grown to include more creative passions such as Screen Casting and Live Mixing under the monicker of DJ Genesis. While these hobbies may be just that - a hobby - they are an amazing avenue for creativity. I find that the more I pursue these outlets - that my passion to code rises. It's no secret that I spend entirely too much time in front of my computer - but now with activites that are less logic oriented, and more creative (meaning I'm putting together a puzzle, without having to make the pieces myself) I find that this stimulates my mind to new heights.

The beautiful part about this story - is my day job has lent a hand in enablement of this passion. Running my own shoutcast server on a super cheap Digital Ocean droplet empowers me to broadcast to several like minded individuals. It's even getting to where there is collaboration afoot on this front. The sheer size of global collaboration has taken a front-seat in my heart, which is a byproduct of working out in the open on Open Source projects. The first take at a joint-mix has begun with a new-friend from the UK that discovered me mixing live and wanted to remix some of the bits I was working with.

### Going International

I took my first steps out of the country in 2014 to Europe for a planning sprint in Brussels Belgium. I have three one word sentences.

This.
Was.
Amazing!

I cant begin to explain how mind blowingly awesome this was. Being surrounded by buildings older than my country was an incredibly humbling experience. There was such a rich culture of small businesses surrounding the area that I was staying in. I think my favorite part of the entire trip was the small Ramen shop I discovered down the street. I enjoyed it so much that I stopped in twice for Ramen while I had the opportunity. There was tons of planning to be had at the sprint, as it was a work-by-day-play-by-evening scenario. I'm jonesing to go back - and it looks like I've received a wish-granted card; I'll be speaking at FOSS CON and running workshops a few towns over at the end of January, early February.

## Whats in store for the future

#### New Workloads

I'm moving teams from Big Data over to the New Workloads team - starting with Kubernetes. We're going to be building some awesome stuff with containers as a first class citizen. The coverage I've given to Flannel and container networking will come in handy. I'm looking forward to touching on the newer bleeding edge tech in the Dev/Ops sphere. 

#### Juju is Orchestration Glue

Thus far I've been posting mostly scenarios where Juju is a phaux PAAS service orchestrator - and that's such a misnomer as to the true purpose of Juju. While it has the capacity to work on a scale of providing Apps as a Service - A key stregth is it's ability to jack in as an orchestrator of services. As a quick rundown more for my own edification of what the primary goals are to keep in mind:

 - A community of expertise
 - Encapsulates best practices for
 - - Deployment
 - - Configuration
 - - Management
 - - Monitoring
 - - How it should and will talk to other services
 - - Scaling
 - - Reference Deployments
 - Every charm is a grown up software project, with its own suite of community, documentation, and practices.

#### Summation

I don't really know where 2015 is going to take me. But if it's anything like 2014: I've got my work cut out for me. I look forward to even more growth, experiences, and honing my craft of geekery. 

Cheers and bring on the challenges!
