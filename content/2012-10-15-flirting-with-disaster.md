It's no secret that I'm having an affiar on .Net -- The problem is, I think I've fallen in love with Ruby. To the point that I want to abscond with ruby and never look back at all the tools I've used over the last 10 years. PHP and .Net both have their place in the ecosystem of programming. But I dont want them anymore. You get so much for free, and so many options. The community is bright and vibrant! Steel City Ruby Conf had me happily hoodwinked and convinced me to give Ruby an honest and hard look.

Now those of you that know me will say "Oh look, there goes another .Net developer to the ruby fad." - I wont correct you. It was a fad, but Ruby's growing community has one thing that other application fad's dont: A vibrantly aware, active, and friendly community. I have yet to meet a fellow rubyist that's greeted me with an air of self importance. If anything, they are Idempotent. They achieve, share, and humble themselves at the opportunity to spread the knowledge. My previous post about moving into the bazaar was really focused upon this single idea. Working in a .Net shop by trade has taken its toll on my skills - I was beginning to stagnate as a developer. I wasn't learning new things, the tech was horrible to wrangle into submission, Selecting from open source solutions in the framework was riddled with abandoned projects with no help in sight. This is simply not an acceptable solution for me, as a software engineer, to continue growing.

I've started to weave ruby into the fabric of application development at work. After a failed attempt to bring PHP into the forefront, we agreed that it was not a good solution. So I took the opportunity to hack up a rails app literally overnight and show them what we got for free. Capistrano deployment excited my co-workers. CopyCopter text indexing excited the management. BrowserCMS has excited ME since I wont have to develop a CMS solution from scratch or pay for overpriced bloated .Net solutions. (Umbraco, you suck. .Net webforms? really?!)  

All in all, I know that I'm flirting with disaster. But this move is going to be a rapid and agile response to a growing maintainability problem I've reached. Workign in marketing means you dont always get full release cycles. You have to be fast on your feet and ready to change at the drop of a hat. When you acquire 4 new clients and the VP demands that you have client sites ready within the week - its as easy as rails new "clientName" - spend 5 minutes configuring gems, databases, and drop in a quick deploy script for staging and you're off and running.

But enough fanfare for what's already a clear winner. If you don't believe me, you should try it yourself. Take the plunge and whip up an app from scratch in 24 hours. You'll be amazed at how much you get for free.
